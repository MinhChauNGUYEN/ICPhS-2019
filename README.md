# ICPhS-2019
This repository provides audio files, figures, and powerpoint slides related to the article at ICPhS 2019 “A glottalized tone in Muong (Vietic): a pilot study based on audio and electroglottographic recordings”.  

Note that the audio and electroglottographic (EGG) signals were simultaneously recorded into stereo files; as this format may not be convenient for all users, each stereo file was later split into two: one audio file (name ending in _AUD.wav), one EGG file (name ending in _EGG.wav).

The following is short explanation of all available materials here.

## Folder "ExpToneSystem_MinimalSets"
This folder provides data (sound) and result (figures) of [my Master study](https://dumas.ccsd.cnrs.fr/dumas-01405496/) on the tone system of Muong (Kim Thượng dialect) in 2016. In detail, it contains: 
1. [Audio files](ExpToneSystem_MinimalSets/Audio) recording 2 minimal sets from speakers M1 (two times), M5, M6, and F1. 
2. [Figures](ExpToneSystem_MinimalSets/Figure) demonstrate the tone system in term of fundamental frequency (f0) and open quotient (Oq) for data of speakers: M1 (second time), M5, and M6.
3. [Metadata](ExpToneSystem_MinimalSets/KTM_METADATA.xlsx) of all available recordings so far (from 2015 to 2018).

**(Work in progress)** The recent obtained data (from fieldwork 2018) is in the process of analysis and will be updated at ICPhS 2019 (August 2019). The phonetic experiment was extented not only in size of corpus with 8 minimal sets, but also in number of speakers with 10 males and 10 females.

## Folder "IsolatedWord_Salt"
This folder contains recordings produced **Figure:** *An example of typical glottalized tone with two realizations: (a) creaky voice, (b) glottal constriction. Speaker F1, syllable /vwɛj/ 'salt'*.  
- That figure was created by Praat using a ['praatfig' script](https://github.com/MinhChauNGUYEN/praatfig).
- EGG signal was analyzed by [PeakDet](https://github.com/alexis-michaud/egg/tree/master/peakdet_inter). The obtained values of f0 and Oq were drawn on Praat's figure.
